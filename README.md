# RoutingNeedle

Council QA benchmark and tiered cascade routing harness for vault document ingestion.
Validates that local LLMs extract correct evidence from vault documents rather than
hallucinating answers from training knowledge.

Forked from CodeNeedle (positional recall benchmark — see [below](#positional-recall-benchmark)).

## Council QA Benchmark

Two-tier council evaluating vault restructure decisions against a binding adjudication matrix.

| Tier | Model | Hardware | Port | Role |
|------|-------|----------|------|------|
| T1 | DeepSeek-V2-Lite Q4_K_M | WX9100 / Vulkan / NUMA node 1 | 8081 | Triage reference; degeneration-tagged |
| T2 | Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M | P5000 / CUDA / NUMA node 0 | 8082 | Authoritative council tier |

**Current standing (2026-05-10, Run 2):** T2 scaffolded 14/15 MATCH (93%). Full workflow in [`COUNCIL_BENCHMARK_WORKFLOW.md`](COUNCIL_BENCHMARK_WORKFLOW.md).

### Start servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — DeepSeek on WX9100 (NUMA node 1)
bash configs/servers/wx9100-deepseek.sh

# Terminal 2 — Qwen on P5000 (NUMA node 0)
bash configs/servers/p5000-qwen30b.sh
```

### Run council tests

```bash
# Blind (Drift Profile only — establish baseline first)
cd bench && python council_blind_test.py
# -> Council_Test_Results_Blind.json

# Scaffolded (Drift Profile + section context per SECTION_MAP)
cd bench && python council_matrix_test.py
# -> Council_Test_Results_Scaffolded.json
```

T1 responses are tagged `T1_degenerated: true` when repetition-loop collapse is detected.
T2 is the authoritative tier. See [`COUNCIL_BENCHMARK_WORKFLOW.md`](COUNCIL_BENCHMARK_WORKFLOW.md) for scoring and iteration process.

## Cascade Routing (TC-01 through TC-08)

Tiered failure propagation for the main document-injection QA suite. T1 handles fast triage;
T2 is called only when T1 triggers an escalation.

```bash
python3 bench/run_suite.py \
  --model configs/models/deepseek-v2-lite-wx9100.toml \
  --cascade configs/models/qwen3-30b-p5000.toml \
  --testcases configs/testcases/ \
  --corpora configs/corpora/ \
  [--queue /home/alex/logs/adjudicator_queue.jsonl]
```

Escalation triggers: `file_size`, `context_pressure` (75% of T1 context window), `token_size`,
`file_type`, `empty_file`, `api_error`, `first_token_decision`, `response_degeneration`.
See [`bench/cascade.py`](bench/cascade.py) for full documentation.

**Standing (2026-05-09):** 8/8 PASS — TC-01 through TC-08.

# Positional Recall Benchmark

Reproduces the benchmark from the YouTube video (see `benchmark_plan.md`):
stuff a large source corpus into an LLM's context, then ask it to reproduce
the first N lines of specific named functions verbatim. Measures positional
recall under long context, not just named-entity lookup.

## Install

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python environment management.

```
# Create a venv in .venv/ and install the deps from requirements.txt
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run any project script via `uv run` (no `source .venv/bin/activate` needed):

```
uv run python bench.py run --corpus http_server --model qwen36-35b
uv run python analysis/visualize.py
uv run python smoke_test.py
```

If you'd rather activate the venv:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 bench.py run --corpus http_server --model qwen36-35b
```

The rest of this README writes commands as `python3 …` for brevity — prepend
`uv run ` if your venv isn't active.

## Quick start

```
# 1. (LM Studio only) make sure your model is loaded with enough context.
#    Defaults can silently sit at 4K. Force-reload at 128K:
lms unload qwen3.6-35b-a3b
lms load qwen3.6-35b-a3b --context-length 131072 --gpu max -y

# 2. Pick a corpus + a model and run them (assumes .venv is active; otherwise prepend `uv run`):
python3 bench.py run --corpus http_server --model qwen36-35b

# 3. Result is auto-saved as results/<corpus>__<model>.json.
```

## Layout

```
configs/
  corpora/        what files to test, sample size — one TOML per corpus
  models/         model identifier and per-model knobs — one TOML per model
fixtures/         source files to test against (jquery.js, http_server.py, …)
results/          JSON dumps from every run, auto-named <corpus>__<model>.json
analysis/
  visualize.py    Plotly dashboard builder
  charts/         generated HTML output (gitignored)
  VIZ_README.md   chart-by-chart explanation + how to extend
.secrets/         API keys for hosted endpoints (gitignored, perms 700)
bench/            package internals
bench.py          CLI entry
```

## Configs

The split is by axis-of-change. You rarely change which files to test, but
you constantly compare different models — so an N×M comparison needs only
N+M files, not N*M.

### Hosted models — API keys

Don't put real keys in committed config files. The recommended workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p .secrets && chmod 700 .secrets
echo 'sk-...' > .secrets/openai.key
chmod 600 .secrets/openai.key
```

Then reference it from a model config:

```toml
# configs/models/gpt-5.5.toml
name              = "gpt-5.5"
base_url          = "https://api.openai.com"
api_key_file      = ".secrets/openai.key"   # path resolved from repo root
temperature       = 1.0
max_tokens        = 8000
reasoning_effort  = "none"
use_max_completion_tokens = true
```

`.secrets/` and any `*.key` file are already in `.gitignore`. Verify with
`git check-ignore -v .secrets/openai.key` — you should see a match.

Alternatives: `api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"` (read from environment), or
`api_key = "..."` (literal — only for non-secret tokens like LM Studio's
`"not-needed"` placeholder).

> Field-by-field reference for every TOML key, plus recipes for adding a new
> corpus or model, lives in [`configs/CONFIG_README.md`](configs/CONFIG_README.md).

### Corpora — `configs/corpora/<name>.toml`

```toml
[files]
directory = "fixtures"   # required
glob      = "*.js"       # required
limit     = 1            # optional cap on matched files (sorted lexically)

[sample]
k    = 16                # number of functions to test
seed = 42
```

Shipped:
- `http_server` — single ~50KB Python file, fits any context, fast iteration
- `jquery` — ~280KB / ~80K-token JS, closest to the video's setup (needs ≥100K loaded context)

If `glob` matches multiple files, they're concatenated with comment-marker
headers (`# === path ===` / `// === path ===`) so the model sees file
boundaries. Cross-file name collisions are deduplicated (first occurrence
wins), and the prompt qualifies by file path when more than one file is in play.

### Models — `configs/models/<name>.toml`

```toml
name              = "qwen3.6-35b-a3b"      # required (model id the server knows)
base_url          = "http://localhost:1234"
api_key           = "not-needed"           # optional
temperature       = 0.0
max_tokens        = 6000                   # leave room for reasoning models
timeout           = 600.0
suppress_thinking = true                   # appends /no_think (harmless when ignored)
```

Shipped:
- `qwen3-4b` — small, honors `/no_think`, `max_tokens=1500` is fine
- `qwen36-35b` — reasoning-on-by-default, ignores every thinking-disable knob; needs `max_tokens=6000`

If you pass `--model FOO` and there's no matching config file, FOO is treated
as a raw model identifier with sane defaults — so you don't *have* to write a
config to do a one-off run, but for repeated use it's worth pinning the knobs.

### How the two configs combine at run time

Every `run` invocation needs **one corpus** (`--corpus NAME` or `--file PATH`)
and **one model** (`--model NAME`). They're resolved independently and stitched
together — there is no shared parent file or inheritance.

**Resolution order**, for both flags:
1. If the value points to an existing file on disk, load it.
2. Otherwise look it up by name under `configs/corpora/<name>.toml` or
   `configs/models/<name>.toml`.
3. (`--model` only) If still not found, treat the value as a raw model
   identifier and use built-in defaults. A note is printed so you know the
   fallback was taken.

**Override layering**, applied in order (later wins):
1. defaults baked into the loader (`max_tokens=6000`, `temperature=0`, …)
2. fields set in the **model config** file
3. CLI overrides — `--base-url`, `--max-tokens`, `--temperature`, `--timeout`,
   `--api-key`
4. sampling overrides (`-k`, `--seed`) layer over the **corpus config**'s
   `[sample]` the same way

This means model knobs can come from anywhere on the chain. A typical config
sets the model-specific defaults (e.g. `max_tokens=6000` for a reasoning model)
and you override per-run knobs (`--max-tokens 8000` for a hard case) without
editing the file.

**`--think`** flips one bit: it inverts `suppress_thinking` so chain-of-thought
is left on. Useful when you specifically want to compare reasoning vs.
no-reasoning recall on a model that supports both.

**Output filename** is `results/<corpus.name>__<model.name>.json`, where each
`name` is the **config stem** (filename without `.toml`). Raw-model fallback
sanitizes the identifier (`/` → `_`). Override the whole path with `--dump`.

Mental model: corpus = *what to ask*, model = *who to ask and how*. Keep them
orthogonal.

Supported source languages: `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` (esprima), `.py` (`ast`).

## Reading the output

Per-function diff uses colors matching the video:

- **gray**       — matched line (expected + produced at correct position)
- **orange**     — expected but missing from the output
- **yellow**     — hallucinated / mangled line
- **blue/cyan**  — extra correct lines past the primary 20 (bonus)

Pass threshold per function: ≥ 8 of the 20 expected lines matched.

## Server setup notes

For fair comparison matching the video:

- **llama.cpp**: `--ctx-size 131072 --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0`,
  prompt caching on (default in recent builds).
- **LM Studio**: set context length to cover the file, enable "KV cache quantization"
  → Q8. Prefix cache is automatic.
- **Ollama**: set `num_ctx` via Modelfile or per-request; no KV quant yet, so
  comparison isn't apples-to-apples.

Keep temperature at 0. Default `max_tokens=6000` to leave room for reasoning models.

### LM Studio gotchas we hit (read before debugging)

1. **`lms ps` lies about context size after JIT loads.** If large prompts fail
   with a 400 "context length" error despite `lms ps` showing a big number,
   force-reload:
   ```
   lms unload <model>
   lms load <model> --context-length 131072 --gpu max -y
   ```
2. **Auto-unload by idle TTL** (default ~60 min). After it expires, the next
   request triggers a JIT reload at *default settings*, silently dropping your
   large context. Either disable TTL in the LM Studio UI or re-load before
   each session.
3. **Reasoning models** (qwen3.5, qwen3.6, …) do not honor `/no_think`,
   `enable_thinking: false`, `reasoning_effort: "none"`, or any other API toggle
   we tested. The benchmark still appends `/no_think` (harmless if ignored), but
   you must give the budget for chain-of-thought *plus* the answer. Default
   `max_tokens=6000`; bump to 8000+ if responses come back empty.
